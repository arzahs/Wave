Wave
====

Wave is a wireless Intrusion Detection System and 802.11 visualizer.  Wireless data is sent from [collector](https://github.com/hkparker/collector)s to Wave where it is analysed and stored in elasticsearch.

Goals
-----

The primary goal of Wave is to detect wireless attacks and alert relevent parties over email.  Performing wireless intrusion detection requires storing captures wireless frames for a short period of time for analysis.  During this analysis, it is also possible to construct a rich graph of live activity and relationships between devices from the wireless metadata.  Wave aims to present the information in the air as a useful and powerful graph.
